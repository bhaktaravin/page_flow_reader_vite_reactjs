# 🎌 Getting Real Manga Pages in PageFlow Reader

Your app already loads **real chapters** from MangaDx API! To get **real manga images** too, you have several options:

## 🚀 Option 1: Local Proxy Server (Recommended)

I've created a local proxy server that will allow real manga images:

### Setup:
```bash
# 1. Install proxy dependencies
cd proxy
npm install

# 2. Start proxy server (in one terminal)
npm start
# ➜ Proxy running on http://localhost:3001

# 3. Start your React app (in another terminal)
cd ..
npm run dev
# ➜ React app on http://localhost:5173
```

### How it works:
- ✅ **Local proxy** handles CORS restrictions
- ✅ **Real manga images** from MangaDx
- ✅ **Automatic fallback** to demo pages if proxy fails
- ✅ **Fast loading** with local caching

## 🌐 Option 2: Browser Extension

I've also created a simple Chrome extension to disable CORS:

### Setup:
1. Open Chrome → Extensions → Developer mode
2. Load unpacked → Select `cors-extension` folder
3. Enable the extension
4. Reload your manga app

## 🔧 Option 3: Public Proxies (Less Reliable)

Your app already tries these automatically:
- AllOrigins
- CORS.sh  
- CORSProxy.io

## 📊 Current Status:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|---------|
| ✅ Search | Real MangaDx API |
| ✅ Manga Info | Real metadata |
| ✅ Chapters | Real chapter lists (97+ chapters) |
| 🔄 Images | Demo pages (can be made real with proxy) |

## 🎯 Quick Test:

1. Start both servers (proxy + React)
2. Search "Horimiya" 
3. Open any chapter
4. Look for console message: `✅ Local Proxy (Best) working!`
5. You should see real manga pages!

## 💡 Notes:

- **Demo pages** are beautiful and show all functionality
- **Real pages** require CORS workaround (that's normal!)
- **Production deployment** would use a backend proxy
- **Current setup** is perfect for development/testing

Your PageFlow Reader is already impressive with real API data! 🚀
